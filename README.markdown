# Tic Tac Toe

Implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe with a CPU enemy based on a naive formulation of
the minimax algorithm. The algorithm currently searches the whole state tree
up to terminal nodes - this is OK for a 3x3 board, but becomes unfeasibly slow
for any larger sizes.

Can be installed using ASDF. Relies on the Alexandria package.
